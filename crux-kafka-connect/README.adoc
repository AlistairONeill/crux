= crux-kafka-connect

**NOT WORKING YET**

This project contains `crux.kafka.connect.CruxSinkConnector` which is
an implementation of `org.apache.kafka.connect.sink.SinkConnector`.

Currently doesn't write anything to Crux and is just a copy of the
example file sink with added upper case transform:
https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/file/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/file

The idea is to use `crux-http-client` initially as a proof of concept.

Download Kafka from https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

Building the sink connector:
```
export KAFKA_HOME=...
lein uberjar
cp target/*-standalone.jar $KAFKA_HOME/libs
cp test-resources/*.properties $KAFKA_HOME/config
```

Steps to get running, in 3 different terminals:

```
(cd $KAFKA_HOME; ./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties)
(cd $KAFKA_HOME; ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties)
(cd $KAFKA_HOME; ./bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/local-file-source.properties config/local-crux-sink.properties)
```

Write a line to

```
echo Hello >> $KAFKA_HOME/test.txt
tail -n1 $KAFKA_HOME/test.sink.txt
```

This should output `HELLO`.
