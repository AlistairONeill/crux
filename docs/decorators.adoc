= Decorators

== Introduction

Decorators are features that can be built on top of Crux that can be used
optionally and can be created easily without needing understand how the core of
Crux works. Use of decorators is currently an advanced topic and requires a
basic understanding of Clojure to configure.

== Aggregation

The
https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/crux-decorators/src/crux/decorators/aggregation/alpha.clj[`aggregation.alpha`]
namespace demonstrates a good example of building a highly general aggregation
extension to the basic Crux query. The standard `api/q` function can now be
ignored as the `aggr/q` function is used instead (it wraps `api/q` with
transducer magic).
