= Transactions

Transactions are how you modify data within Crux.

See the pages for <<transactions-clojure.adoc#,Clojure>> and <<transactions-java.adoc#,Java>> for their respective syntax.

[#transaction-time]
== Transaction Time

When you submit a transaction, the current time will be the Transaction Time.

[#valid-times]
== Valid Times

When an optional `valid time` is omitted from a transaction operation, the Transaction Time will be used as `valid time`.

[#valid-time]
=== Only Valid Time Provided

When `valid time` is used as a parameter for Put or Delete, it specifies the time from which the change is valid.

If there is a document, `A`, already present at the given `valid time`, the operation's effect is valid from `valid time` to the end of the current validity of `A`.

[#end-valid-time]
=== End Valid Time

When both `valid time` and `end valid time` are provided for Put or Delete, the operation's effect is valid from `valid time` (inclusive) to `end valid time` (exclusive).
