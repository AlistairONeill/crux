= Query Design

== Introduction

This document serves as a guide for understand the query internals of
Crux.

== Index

Crux has the fundamental notion of an index.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=Index]
----

The two operations are `seek` and `next`.

== Layered Index

The layered index exists to facilitate the idea of navigating up and
down an index, in a tree like manner.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=LayeredIndex]
----

For example the index `attribute+value+entity+content-hash` is the following tree:

[graphviz, diagram-classes, png]
....
digraph G
{
attribute->value
value->entity
entity->content

}
....

`open-level` gives instructions to open and move down a level. In the
above example if could be moving the index down to point at the values
within a given attribute. That is to say that if we have an attribute
`:name`, the index will iterate across all values for that attribute,
until there are no more `name` values.

`close-level` moves the index back-up, so in the above example, we can
iterate at the higher level of attribute.

== Virtual Index

A Virtual Index comprises together multiple child indices. This is
to join indices together, returning key/value pairs on where they match.

A join condition in a query could be reflected by a Virtual Index. A
Virtual Index will maintain state as to where Index is currently
positioned.

`UnaryJoinVirtualIndex` comprises of multiple child indices and
implements both `Index` and `LayeredIndex`. Calling `seek-values` on
it will advance all the child indices internally until they all
contain the same key. This involves calling `seek-values` on each
child index until the indices match at the same level. Calling
`next-values` would move all the indices along until the next common
key that all the indices share.

.Virtual Index Example
[#virtual-index,cols="d,d,d,d,s,d,s,d"]
|===
|`a`|0|1||3|4|5|6
|`b`|0||2|3||5|
|`c`|||2|3|4|5|6
|===

In the above example, where `UnaryJoinVirtualIndex` joins three
`RelationVirtualIndexs` (a,b,c). Calling `seek-values` would return 3
as the first value found.

Calling `next-values` would jump ahead to the value 5.

TODO: JP: I need to understand the Nary vs Unary testing index-test.
