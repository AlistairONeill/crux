= *Confluent Platform Quickstart*

== Installing the connector

Use `confluent-hub install zip-file-name` to download and install the connector from Confluent hub. The downloaded connector is then placed within your confluent install's _'share/confluent-hub-components'_ folder. +

The connector can be used as either a *source* or a *sink*. In either case, there should be an associated *Crux node* to communicate with.

== Example usage

Open a REPL within `crux-dev`, and run the following commands:

[source,clj]
----
(dev)
(start)
(k/create-topic (:admin-client node) "connect-test" 1 1 nil)
----

This will create an embedded Kafka broker within Crux, along with *Crux node* called _node_. The topic _'connect-test'_, (used within the *local-crux-sink* and *local-crux-source* property files by default) is then created by the embedded broker, with _node_ being associated with the topic.

== Sink Connector

Run the following command within the base of the Confluent folder, to create a worker which connects to the _'connect-test'_ topic, ready to *send* messages to the _node_. This also makes use of *connect-file-source*, checking for changes in a file called _'test.txt'_:

----
./bin/connect-standalone etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties share/confluent-hub-components/juxt-crux-kafka-connect/etc/local-crux-sink.properties etc/kafka/connect-file-source.properties
----

Run the following within your Confluent directory, to add a line of JSON to _'test.txt'_:

----
echo '{"crux.db/id": "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84", "value": "baz"}' >> test.txt
----

Now, verify that this was transacted within your REPL:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/entity (crux/db node) "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84")
==>
{:crux.db/id #crux/id "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84", :value "baz"}
----

== Source Connector

Run the following command within the base of the Confluent folder, to create a worker connects to the 'connect-test' topic, ready to *receive* messages from the _node_. This also makes use of 'connect-file-sink', outputting transactions to your _node_ within _'test.sink.txt'_:

----
./bin/connect-standalone etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties share/confluent-hub-components/juxt-crux-kafka-connect/etc/local-crux-source.properties etc/kafka/connect-file-sink.properties
----


Within your REPL, transact an element into Crux:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/submit-tx node [[:crux.tx/put {:crux.db/id #crux/id "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c82", :value "baz-source"}]])
----

Check the contents of 'test.sink.txt' using the command below, and you should see that the transactions were outputted to the _'connect-test'_ topic:

----
tail test.sink.txt
==>
[[:crux.tx/put {:crux.db/id #crux/id "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c82", :value "baz-source"} #inst "2019-09-19T12:31:21.342-00:00"]]
