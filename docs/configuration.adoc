== Nodes

To start a Crux node, use the
https://juxt.pro/crux/docs/javadoc/index.html[Java API] or the Clojure
https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/crux-core/src/crux/api.clj[`crux.api`].

There are different configurations of a Crux node:

.Crux Nodes
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d,d"]
|===
|Name|Transaction Log|Java API
|Cluster|Uses Kafka|`Crux.startClusterNode options;`
|JDBC|Uses JDBC event log|`Crux.startJDBCNode options;`
|Standalone|Uses local event log|`Crux.startStandaloneNode options;`
|===

Use a cluster node when horizontal scalability is required or when
you want the guarantees that Kafka offers in terms of resiliency,
availability, and retention of data.

Multiple cluster nodes participate in a cluster using Kafka as the primary
store and as the central means of coordination.

The JDBC node is for when you don't want the overhead of maintaining a
Kafka cluster. Read more about the motivations of this setup
https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/crux-jdbc.html[here].

The Standalone node is where a single Crux instance has everything
it needs locally. This is good for experimenting with Crux and
for small to medium sized deployments, where running a single instance
is permissible.

Crux nodes implement the `ICruxAPI` interface and are the
starting point for making use of Crux. Nodes also implement
`java.io.Closeable` and can therefore be lifecycle managed.

NOTE: To see an example of a Crux Node being integrated into a
Clojure lifecycle management framework such as Integrant, see the
https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/docs/example_standalone_integrant_node.clj[example
Integrant node].

== Properties

The follow properties are required for any type of Crux Node:

.Nodes Configuration
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d,d"]
|===
|Component|Property|Description
|kv-store|`kv-backend`|Sets the K/V Store to use, e.g. `"crux.kv.rocksdb.RocksKv"`
|kv-store|`db-dir`|Sets the data-directory to use, e.g. `"data/db-dir-1"`
|tx-log|`bootstrap-servers`|Kafka Servers to connect to e.g. `"localhost:9092"`
|http-server|`server-port`|Port for Crux HTTP Server e.g. `8080`
|===

== RocksDB

[#rocksdep]
=== Project Dependency

Add RocksDB as a project dependency:

[source,clj,subs="normal"]
----
include::./deps.edn[tags=RocksDeps]
----

=== Configuration

Set the following properties when configuring RocksDB in Crux:

.Rocks Configuration
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d"]
|===
|Property|Value
|`kv-backend`|`"crux.kv.rocksdb.RocksKv"`
|`db-dir`|i.e. `"data/db-dir-1"`
|===

For example, when constructing the standalone node:

[source,clj]
----
include::./examples.clj[tags=start-standalone-with-rocks]
----

== Http

Crux can be used programmatically as a library, but Crux also ships
with an embedded HTTP server, that allows clients to use the API
remotely via REST.

Set the `server-port` configuration property on a Crux node to
expose a HTTP port that will accept REST requests:

.HTTP Nodes Configuration
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d,d"]
|===
|Component|Property|Description
|http-server|`server-port`|Port for Crux HTTP Server e.g. `8080`
|===

Visit the guide on using the <<rest#rest,REST api>> for examples
of how to interact with Crux over HTTP.

== Docker

If you want to experiment with Crux using a demo Docker container from
Docker Hub (no JVM/JDK/Clojure install required, only Docker!)  then
please see the
https://github.com/juxt/crux/tree/master/docs/example/standalone_webservice[standalone
web service example]. You can also use this self-contained
demonstration image to experiment with the <<rest.adoc#,REST API>>.

== Backup and Restore

Crux provides utility APIs for local backup and restore when you are
using the standalone mode. For an example of usage, see
https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/e5e21352b7a466d20a7b57518e129770191de352/example/standalone_webservice/src/example_standalone_webservice/main.clj#L744[the
standalone web service example].

An additional example of backup and restore is provided that only
applies to a stopped standalone node
https://github.com/juxt/crux/tree/master/docs/example/backup-restore[here].

In a clustered deployment, only Kafka's
https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka/post-deployment.html#backup-and-restoration[official
backup and restore] functionality should be relied on to provide safe
durability. The standalone mode's backup and restore operations can
instead be used for creating operational snapshots of a node's indexes
for scaling purposes.


[#standalone]
== Standalone Node

Using a Crux standalone node is the best way to get started. Once
you've started a standalone Crux instance as described below, you can
then follow the <<get_started.adoc#,getting started
example>>.

image::local-standalone-mode.svg[Local Standalone Mode,width=70%,align="center"]

.Standalone Configuration
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d,d"]
|===
|Component|Property|Description
|tx-log|`event-log-dir`|where to store events locally, i.e. `"data/eventlog-1"`
|===

=== Project Dependency

[source,clj]
----
include::./deps.edn[tags=CruxDep]
----

=== Start the standalone node:

[source,clj]
----
include::./examples.clj[tags=start-node]
----

You can later stop the node if you wish:

[source,clj]
----
include::./examples.clj[tags=close-node]
----
