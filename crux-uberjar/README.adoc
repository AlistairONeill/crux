= crux-uberjar

This project is used to run `lein uberjar` which creates a cluster-node uberjar
and a standalone uberjar.

An uberjar is a single jar file that contains the contents of all your
dependencies. Users can run it with a simple java invocation, or on some
systems just by double-clicking the jar file.
