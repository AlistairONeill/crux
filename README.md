Crux is an open source document database with bitemporal graph queries. Java
and Clojure APIs are provided.

Crux follows an _unbundled_ architectural approach, which means that it is
assembled from highly decoupled components through the use of semi-immutable
logs at the core of its design. Logs can currently be stored in LMDB or RocksDB
for standalone single-node deployments, or using Kafka for clustered
deployments. Indexes can currently be stored using LMDB or RocksDB.

At its core Crux is built for efficient bitemporal indexing of schemaless
documents, and this simplicity enables broad possibilities for creating layered
extensions on top, such as to add additional transaction, query, and schema
capabilities. Crux does not currently support SQL but it does provides an
EDN-based Datalog query interface that can be used to express a comprehensive
range of SQL-like join operations as well as recursive graph traversals.

## Using Clojure

Please note that Clojure is not _required_ when using Crux.

### Building

``` sh
lein uberjar
java -jar target/crux-*-standalone.jar --help
```

### Developing

Start a REPL. To run the system with embedded Kafka and ZK:

``` clojure
(dev)
(start)
```

This will store data under `dev-storage` in the checkout directory.

### Testing

The recommended way of running the primary tests is `lein test`.
