= crux-kafka

This project contains `crux.kafka.KafkaTxLog` which is an implementation of
`TxLog` backed underpinned by Apache Kafka for strong durability and
scalability guarantees. 

For tests, see `/crux-test/test/crux/kafka_test.clj`.

This project also contains the `crux.bootstrap.cluster-node` namespace which
manages the lifecycle of a Kafka-based `cluster-node` system.
